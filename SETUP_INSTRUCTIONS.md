# Contact Form Setup Instructions

The contact form has been updated to use **Web3Forms** - a free service that requires no backend configuration.

## What I Did

1. **Removed Supabase dependency** from the contact form
2. **Integrated Web3Forms API** - a completely free service (no credit card required)
3. **Created environment variable setup** for your access key
4. **Updated .gitignore** to protect your environment variables

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Get Your Free Web3Forms Access Key

1. Go to https://web3forms.com
2. Click "Get Started Free" or "Create Access Key"
3. Enter your email address (fuzarevi@gmail.com)
4. They'll send you an access key instantly (check your inbox)
5. Copy the access key

### Step 2: Create Your .env File

1. In your project root directory, create a file named `.env`
2. Add this line (replace with your actual key):
   ```
   VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_access_key_here
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Web3Forms Dashboard (Optional but Recommended)

1. Log into https://web3forms.com with your email
2. Configure where you want form submissions sent (defaults to your signup email)
3. Optional settings:
   - Custom email templates
   - Email subject line customization
   - Auto-responder to users
   - Spam filtering
   - Form submission notifications

### Step 4: Test Your Form

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to your contact page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check your email for the submission

### Step 5: Deploy (Important!)

When deploying to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), make sure to add the environment variable:

**For Vercel:**
- Go to your project settings
- Navigate to "Environment Variables"
- Add: `VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` = your access key

**For Netlify:**
- Go to Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment
- Add: `VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` = your access key

**For Lovable:**
- If Lovable is unblocked now, you can add environment variables in their dashboard

## What Changed in the Code

- `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` - Removed Supabase, added Web3Forms API call
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- `.gitignore` - Added .env files to prevent committing secrets

## Benefits

- **100% Free** - No credit card required
- **Unlimited submissions** on free tier (with Web3Forms branding)
- **No backend needed** - Works immediately
- **Instant setup** - Just get an access key
- **Email notifications** - Sent to your email automatically
- **No database** - Simpler infrastructure
- **Works everywhere** - No deployment issues

## Troubleshooting

**Form doesn't submit:**
- Check that you created the `.env` file in the project root
- Verify the environment variable name is exactly: `VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY`
- Restart your dev server after adding the .env file

**Not receiving emails:**
- Check your spam folder
- Verify your Web3Forms access key is correct
- Log into Web3Forms dashboard to see if submissions are being received
